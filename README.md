Exploring generative AI to revolutionize healthcare IT solutions

# Introduction

In this digital age, the fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and information technology (IT) offers unprecedented opportunities to revolutionize industries. To explore the current art of the possible, I am embarking on a research project that will leverage AI to develop innovative IT solutions.

# Project Scope

The project will focus on a realistic enterprise scenario: creating an end-to-end healthcare solution for healthcare providers. It will integrate various components, including electronic health records, a payment account system, and seamless integration with a partner insurance company. Additionally, the solution will empower insurance companies to define coverages and manage individual patient cases effectively.

# The Role of AI

While AI alone cannot develop the entire solution, the goal is to explore how an architect, in this case myself, can collaborate with AI to accelerate the development process. By leveraging AI's capabilities, we aim to enhance productivity and assess the achievable levels of efficiency.

## Background and Experience

As a journeyman architect with a diverse background in software, infrastructure architecture, insurance, banking, and healthcare, my broad exposure allows me to guide AI solutions in the right direction, enabling the creation of a synergistic "cyborg" combination of human and AI capabilities.

# AI Tools and Agents

The project will utilize AI tools to develop specific agents with distinct personas. These agents will address various aspects of the solution, such as testing requirements management, architecture, testing strategy and execution, code review, and asset review. Additionally, we aim to establish vector databases of project assets, including documents and code, to facilitate quick and easy access for the AI agents.

# Project Timeline and Milestones

The project will span 12 months, beginning with the articulation of a clear vision, key requirements, and architectural principles. Subsequent phases will involve more detailed requirements gathering, architectural design, strategy formulation, and policy development. The project will culminate in the creation of a backlog and the development of code assets.

# Technology Choices

The project will prioritize the use of cloud-native technology, open-source software, and public domain software. This approach aligns with the principles of optionality and flexibility, allowing clients to incorporate different components as needed.

# Solution Scope and Innovation

While the scenario of an electronic medical records (EMR) solution linked with an account and practice management system is a traditional enterprise architecture solution, the project aims to push the boundaries of innovation. We will explore the integration of AI smarts and investigate alternative user interfaces, such as voice control, to enhance the user experience.

# Documentation and Collaboration

The project will be managed primarily on GitHub, utilizing the wiki area for publishing vision statements, documentation, and the code repository. As the project progresses, we will continuously update the documentation to reflect the latest developments and findings.

# Conclusion

This research project holds immense promise in exploring the convergence of AI and IT. By collaborating with AI, we aim to accelerate the development of innovative healthcare solutions, enhance productivity, and redefine the boundaries of what is achievable. The project will contribute to the advancement of healthcare IT and lay the foundation for future innovations in this rapidly evolving field.
